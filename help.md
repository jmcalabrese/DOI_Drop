DOI drop takes a DOI, looks it up via the crossref API, and returns the corresponding reference. You can then check the reference for accuracy, note any corrections that need to be made, and submit it to the database. 

To use the app:

1. Paste the DOI in the `Enter a DOI` box and press the `Get reference` button
2. Check the resulting reference for errors
3. Briefly describe any corrections in the `Note corrections` box
4. Click `Submit` to save the reference and correction notes
5. To submit another reference, click `Reset all fields`, and repeat the above steps
