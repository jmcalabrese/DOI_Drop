# DOI_Drop

A webapp to download scientific references from the crossref API in RIS format. After download, the user is 
then given the chance to note any correction that need to be made before submitting the ref. Once submitted, the ref 
is written to file in the app's directory.

DOI_Drop was written to help automate the management of my (JMC) department's references database. As such, DOI_Drop
is not really intended for general purpose use, though I'm happy if anyone else finds a use for it.
